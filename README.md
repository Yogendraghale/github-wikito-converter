# 3DEnvBuilder README

## Overview

3DEnvBuilder is an innovative software project designed to transform 360-degree videos into immersive, editable 3D environments. By leveraging advanced AI algorithms, it allows users to navigate and interact with converted 3D spaces, offering the ability to customize these environments by adding or removing objects. This project aims to provide an intuitive and engaging platform suitable for various applications, including virtual reality experiences, educational tools, architectural visualization, and interactive media.

## Features

- **360-Degree Video to 3D Conversion**: Utilize AI to convert 360-degree video footage into dynamic 3D environments.
- **Interactive 3D Navigation**: Explore the 3D spaces from multiple angles and perspectives for a comprehensive understanding of the environment.
- **Object Manipulation**: Add, delete, and adjust objects within the 3D environment to customize the scene to your liking.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Accessible through both web and desktop applications, ensuring a broad user reach.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for users with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Node.js (latest stable version)
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3DEnvBuilder.git
   cd 3DEnvBuilder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   For the web application:
   ```
   cd web
   npm install
   ```

   For the desktop application:
   ```
   cd desktop

   - To run the desktop application:
     ```
     cd desktop
     npm start
     ```

## Usage

After starting the application, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser for the web application or use the desktop application that should have opened automatically.

1. **Import a 360-Degree Video**: Use the import feature to upload your 360-degree video file.
2. **Conversion**: The software will automatically start converting the video into a 3D environment. This process might take a few minutes depending on the video's length and complexity.
3. **Explore and Edit**: Once the conversion is complete, use the navigation tools to explore the 3D environment. Utilize the object manipulation features to customize the scene.
4. **Save Your Work**: Don't forget to save your modified environment for future access or export it for use in other applications.
